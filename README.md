# Hi, I'm Soohwan

Electrical & Electronic Engineering (EE) student  
interested in **AI, game logic, and system-level problem solving**.

I enjoy building things end-to-end, but I care more about  
**why a certain design works**, **where the bottlenecks are**,  
and **how performance can be improved through iteration**.

---

## About Me
- EE undergraduate with a strong interest in software-driven systems
- Mainly work with **Python**, focusing on algorithms and practical optimization
- Prefer explaining trade-offs, failure cases, and improvements  
  rather than just presenting final results
- Actively document trial-and-error and design decisions on my blog

## Featured Projects

### 01. Gomoku Minimax AI (Pygame)
- Gomoku AI built with **Minimax + Alpha-Beta Pruning**
- Designed a **pattern-based heuristic evaluation function**
- Reduced search space by generating moves only near existing stones
- Tuned performance with attack/defense weights and move ordering
- Focused on moving from a naive implementation to a **practically playable speed**

👉 Repository: https://github.com/ImSoohwan/gomoku-minimax-ai

### 02. Game Automation Macro
- GUI-based automation tool for repetitive in-game inputs
- Features include coordinate presets, config file management, and logging
- Experience in turning a script into a **usable application**

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Languages**: Python, C
- **Tools / Frameworks**: Pygame, Git, GitHub
- **Interests**:
  - Game AI (Minimax, heuristics)
  - Performance optimization
  - Automation
  - System-level design and debugging

---

## Writing
I write about development processes, design decisions,  
and what I learned from things that did *not* work as expected.

## Note
I value **understanding and iteration** over quick solutions,  
and I try to reflect that mindset in both code and documentation.
